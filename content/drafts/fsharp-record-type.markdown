Record Types makes tuples more flexible - also commonly referred to as "Labelled Tuples". Record Types can store multiple elements in a single value. Unlike tuples, each element has an associated name that can be used to access it. This makes record types more expressive and flexible. Same set of elements with similar type can be clearly used to depict separate things.
