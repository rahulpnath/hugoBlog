I have also been looking for productivity hacks and keep trying new systems and ways. GIven my nature of work being in front of a screen, the productivity tools has also been digital in nature. However at the start of the this year I came across an intersting book [Digial Minimalism](TDK). After reading this book I have changed my de-facto relationship with many of apps that I use by default and have been trying to reduce the use as well. I discovered the book while I was skimming through another [blog post related to Bullet Journaling](TDK) which also had caught my interest around the same time.

I have been bullet journaling since February 2019, but it is only reently that I have started finding it more useful and have built a workflow around it. When I started with this method I was using it more as a reactive journaling tool and mostly capturing things that already happened. Even though I did plan ahead a few things and put it in the journal, I did not have any formalized practice for this.

Off late I came across the Youtube channel by Matt Ragland who shares a lot of tips around bullet journaling and the various strategies that he uses around it to get more productive. I took on some inspirations from it and also from a few other sources and tweaked my existing process.

If you are starting fresh and trying to organize yourself one of the first activity that I suggest to do is a Brain Dump. TDK

Once you have the brain dumped out onto paper try and choose two to four top priority items for you on that. usually I choose things with a different theme/impact. For e.g my main three items (in no particular order) are:

- Fitness (Running, Cycling and Swimming)
- Giving Back (Blog and Youtube Channel)
- Learning

### Monthly Planning

Before start of every month (usually the last day of the previous month) I plan for the upcoming month and capture some of the key things I want to achieve that month. This generally is alligned with the my top priority items and helps move those items forward. For e.g Looking at 'Giving Back' I might list down the actual blog posts that I am going to publish that month and also the Youtube Videos. I try to align the blog posts and the videos so that work done for one can be used for the other as well. As for fitness I might plan ahead for any events happening or that I want to attend etc. Usually I follow some kind of a running plan which spans across couple of months, so I don't have to particularly work out any such details.

I add in a habit tracker for osme of the key htings that I want to track that month. for example I try to stretch everyday once I wake up, drink lots of water, make sure I journal etc. So I track these everyday using my habit traker (More on it on the Daily Planning section.)

### Weekly Planning

Every Sunday evening I spend 15-20 minutes to map out the upcoming week. Usually it invovles reflecting on the week that has passed, carying over unfinished items, capturing the things that needs to be done the coming week etc. I also create my running workout plans in Garmin Calendar and sync that back with my watch. 

### Daily Planning

Every day before bed I spend 5-10 minutes updaing my bullet journal and plan for the next day. Looking at the weeks plan I work out the tasks for the following day and try to break up what actually I should be doing to move each item on the list forward. I also maintain another journal just to capture my thoughts and random things (which are not task/action based.). I capture the most important things that has happened that day and some reflection if any. this is just osmeting I am trying out to see if there is any use or not.
