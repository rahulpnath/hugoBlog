I have always been looking for productivity hacks and keep trying new systems and ways. Given my nature of work is to be in front of a computer, my productivity tool choices has also been digital. However at the start of the this year I came across an intersting book [Digial Minimalism](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/digital-minimalism/). After reading this book I have changed my de-facto relationship with many of apps and the phone in general. I discovered the book while I was skimming through another [blog post related to Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/book-log) which also had caught my interest around the same time.

> Though it does require a journal, [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about) is a methodology. **It's best described as a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system. It's designed to help you organize your what while you remain midnful of your why.** The goal of the Bullet Journal is to help its practitioners (Bullet Journalists) live intentional lives, ones that are both productive and meaningful.

Even though there is an [official bullet journal notebook](https://bulletjournal.com/products/notebook), this does work on any notebook/journal that you have. Checkout the [quick introduction to Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) and also the Recommended reading at the end of this post.

I have been bullet journaling since February 2019, but it is only recently that I have started finding it more useful and have built a workflow around it. When I started with this method I was using it more as a reactive journaling tool and mostly capturing things after they happened. Even though I did plan ahead a few things and put it in the journal, I did not have any formalized practice around this. Off late I came across the Youtube channel by [Matt Ragland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLH7F4dM2fNtxy_Hr1Gtq0Q) who shares a lot of tips around bullet journaling and the various strategies that he uses around it to get more productive. I took on some inspirations from it and also from a few other sources and tweaked my existing process.

### Journaling Supplies

If you seach for Bullet Journaling on the internet it's very likly that you are going to be shown a lot of artistic pages, people talking about the various stationary items (pens, stickers, markers, washi tapes etc.). But if you are like me (not very artistic) and don't care much about it, just ignore all that. All you need is a pen and paper (preferably a book). I use the a dot grid journal as it gives a good alignment and guides to draw lines and align lists.

- [Staedtler Triplus fineliner](https://www.staedtler.com.au/en/products/ink-writing-instruments/fineliners/triplus-fineliner-334-triangular-fineliner/) (Very rarely used)

*Most of the non-artistic bullet journalists go by the name 'Minimalist Bullet Journal', which might be a easy way to land them on the internet if you are looking for inspiration.*

### Brain Dump
If you are starting fresh and trying to organize yourself one of the first activity that I suggest to do is a Brain Dump. At any point in time, there are a lot of things in my mind and things that I kept committing to myself and others. It is not possible to keep up with everything that I wish to do. So the very first thing to do is to dump everything out onto to paper and then decide what needs attention. The [Incompletion Trigger List](http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf) assists to get everything out of your mind onto paper. It's a good idea to block some time of yours to perform this exercise and give it all the attention it needs. At times it helps to ***Slow Down to Go Fast***.

Once you have the brain dumped onto paper try and choose two to four top priority items for you on that. usually I choose things with a different theme/impact. For e.g my main three items (in no particular order) are:

- Fitness (Running, Cycling and Swimming)
- Blog and Youtube Channel
- Learning

### Monthly Planning

Before start of every month (usually the last day of the previous month) I plan for the upcoming month and capture some of the key things I want to achieve that month. This generally is alligned with the my top priority items and helps move those items forward. For e.g I might list down the actual blog posts that I am going to publish that month and also the Youtube Videos. I try to align the blog posts and the videos so that work done for one can be used for the other as well. However, I am not that organized to always be able to come up with blog posts upfront - like the month below (in the image). As for fitness I might plan ahead for any events happening or that I want to attend etc. Usually I follow some kind of a running plan which spans across couple of months, so I don't have to particularly work out any such details.

I add in a habit tracker for some of the key things that I want to track for that month. For e.g. I try to stretch everyday after waking up, drink lots of water, make sure I journal etc. So I track these everyday using my habit traker (More on it on the Daily Planning section). For reminders and things that needs to be done on specific days I still use [Todoist](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/).

### Weekly Planning

Every Sunday evening I spend 15-20 minutes to map out the upcoming week. Usually it invovles reflecting on the week that has passed, carying over unfinished items, capturing the things that needs to be done the coming week etc. I also create my running workout plans in Garmin Calendar and sync that back with my watch.

### Daily Planning

Every day before bed I spend 5-10 minutes updaing my bullet journal and plan for the next day. Looking at the weeks plan I work out the tasks for the following day and try to break up what actually I should be doing to move each item on the list forward. This is the time I update the habit tracker and cross off items that I have achieved for the day. The idea with the habit tracker is to try and not break the chain. Even if I miss one day I try to make sure I get that done the following. I also maintain another journal to capture my thoughts and random things (which are not task/action based). I capture the most important things that has happened that day and reflections if any. This is a new trial and I might stick to it if I find value in doing it.

Sticking to these three planning techniques has helped me be more focused and get more things done. The very act of writing things down and rewriting them again (when undone) forces me to be mindful about what I am commiting to and doing. I still struggle on the execution side at times and procastinate. There are days I don't get anything done. But the very act of daily planning helps me reflect over those days and be more mindful about it the following day. This helps even out the ups and downs over a period and help me get things done. The very act of putting it on paper gives a stronger sense to complete the task and stick with the plan.

Hope this helps you on your journey!
