I am recording YouTube videos and over the past couple of months I am trying to be more regular at it.

First things first - Kindly subscribe to my channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/rahulnathp

Couple of years back I had written about [recording my first screencast](/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/). Things have changed a lot since then, so I thought of putting this post together on my current setup. In this blog post I will walk through my current YouTube setup, the equipments, softwares and the recording process.

### Equipment Setup

It's been three plus years since I published the [first YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Qmk3TQJ44). So far it's the video with the most views. However, I don't think that is my best video in terms of content and delivery. Ever since that first video, I have been trying to make minor changes each time I record. Part of this also involves updating my gear used for recording.

#### Audio

One of the key advice to anyone starting out creating videos is to get a good microphone and I did the right when I started off with this whole video making process. I knew that I wanted to make more videos, even though I was not quiet sure if I would have the motivation to stick with that for a longer time. So I risked spending some money (actually quiet a bit) for my very first microphone, even that I was not quiet sure.

- [**WS2 Pop Filter**](http://www.rode.com/accessories/ws2)

The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It's a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.

#### Video

Most of my videos are screencasts showing me doing something on the computer. This means the main content is the screen. When I started out I just had my screen and a voice over. However after a couple of videos, I wanted a video of myself as well as a pip video. It gives me a feeling of being more connected to you while watching the video. I started out with a [Logitech c922 HD camera](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam) but soon moved on to a DSLR setup inspired by [Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GoodBetterBestCreatingTheUltimateRemoteWorkerWebcamSetupOnABudget.aspx).

- Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable (for camera to Elgato)

With the dummy battery the camera never runs out of battery and I don't have to worry about running out of charging during a recording. I have the camera mounted on the Neewer ring light stand. I might move it to a separate mount.

#### Lights

Lighting is really important when shooting yourself. I am using one our spare bedroom as my office, which unfortunately does not have much sunlight coming in. Even if it had sunlight, it would not be of much good, as I do all my [recording early morning](/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/). I got myself a 14" [ring light by Neewer](TDK https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B078996ZTR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I need to play around a bit more with my lighting setup and work out some more interesting and proper light setup.

### Software Tools

> - [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html)

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- Windows Camera App
- Auphonic https://auphonic.com/
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create-a-design)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=3a20a52080794911b51074f18356e15f)

Windows is my primary work machine and is where I record the videos. So most of the software are specific to it. The primary recording softwares are [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html), for recording the screen, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for the sound and the default Camera App in Windows for the video from the Sony Alpha.

Before recording I switch my [primary 4k monitor](TDK) to **1980px x 1080px**(Full HD) resolution. It is important to **record, edit and publish in the same size settings**. All three softwares record the audio. When editing it makes it easy to align the videos together.

> Record, Edit and Publish in the same size

Camlink used to crash/freeze on me randomly when I record. After connecting Camlink directly to my laptop instead of the dock station this problem is no longer there. Reditt say's it's most likely [Camlink overloading the USB link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElgatoGaming/comments/av88yd/camlink_freezing_mid_stream/ehdq6bq).

> **PRO TIP**: Snap you fingers, like a [clapperboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard). The sharp spike in the audio waveform helps to align.

Before start of editing I process the audio in Audacity - mostly sticking to Normalize and Amplify. For the past couple of videos I use [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/), an automatic audio post production web service and have been pretty happy with the results. Part of this might be my laziness to learn the Audacity tool and coming up with a audio production workflow. I am currently on the 2 hour per month trial with Auphonic.

Most of the editing happen in Camtasia, where I import the audio, video and the screen recording into the same project. Layer them up depending on how you want it in the final video. I have the camera video on top and the screen below it. Audio position is not important. Once all the different layers are aligned, I separate the audio and video for the camera and screen recordings and
delete them.

I upgraged to Camtaisa 2019 from Camtasia 8 recently and been liking the new interface and experience. I like the overall UI and the layout better, the default library assets are much better, better keyboard shortcuts support and the Alt + drag to extend a frame is a real bonus. However I still find editing taking a major portion of my overall workflow. I am not sure if this is because of the way I record, lack of proper tools or a mix of both. I might give Adobe Premier Pro a go some time to see if that makes it any better.

#### YouTube Thumbnails

I use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create-a-design) for making thumbnails for YouTube. Canva has an inbuilt template for YouTube thumbnails and makes it easy. For stock photos for the thumbnail I mostly use [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/). I am on the free version of all the above softwares. For the photos make sure to give appropriate credits. I usually put the name and details in the YouTube description for the video.

#### Planning and Recording Workflow

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=3a20a52080794911b51074f18356e15f) for most of my personal notes and planning. I recently migrated to Notion from OneNote and like it way better. I recommend giving it a try. I keep a list of ideas for my videos in there and a rough plan on when to publish it. The week before recording a video, I script out the main flow of the video along with the any associated code. Most of the time I try to align videos along with my blog posts, so that

![](/images/youtube_planner.jpg)

I record my videos early in the morning and try to finish the full recording in one setting. The videos average around 10 minutes and takes around an hour to record. I try do the editing in batches as when I get time.

I make videos because I like sharing my work and help others along. I also learn new things doing this. When asked for tips for begineer youtuber, someone said on the internet that "Record the first 100 videos as fast as possible. Don't look at the quality but focus on the quantity. It's after the 100 that the real videos start coming out". So if you are still on the fence line don't wait any longer. Don't wait to get all the perfect equipment or tools to start.
