I am recording YouTube videos and over the past couple of months I am trying to be more regular at it.

First things first - Kindly subscribe to my channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/rahulnathp

Couple of years back I had written about [recording my first screencast](/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/). Things have changed a lot since then, so I thought of putting this post together on my current setup. In this blog post I will walk through my current YouTube setup, the equipment I use to record, the software that helps me and the process that I follow to record them.

### Equipment Setup

It's been three plus years since I published the [first video to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Qmk3TQJ44) and by far that has been the video with the most views as well. However, I don't think that is my best video in terms of content and delivery. Ever since that first video, I have been trying to make minor changes to improve my videos each time. Part of this also involves updating my gear used for recording.

#### Audio

One of the key advice to anyone starting out creating videos is to get a good microphone and I did the right when I started off with this whole video making process. I knew that I wanted to make more videos, even though I was not quiet sure if I would have the motivation to stick with that for a longer time. So I risked spending some money (actually quiet a bit) for my very first microphone, even that I was not quiet sure.

The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It's a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.

#### Video

Most of my videos are screencasts showing me doing something on the computer. This means the main content is the screen. When I started out I just had my screen and a voice over. However after a couple of videos, I wanted a video of myself as well as a pip video. It gives me a feeling of being more connected to you while watching the video. I started out with a [Logitech c922 HD camera](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam) but soon moved on to a DSLR setup inspired by [Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GoodBetterBestCreatingTheUltimateRemoteWorkerWebcamSetupOnABudget.aspx).

#### Lights

Lighting is really important when shooting yourself. I am using one our spare bedroom as my office, which unfortunately does not have much sunlight coming in. Even if it had sunlight, it would not be of much good, as I do all my [recording early morning](/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/).

### Recording Workflow

- Script Highlights
  Need to improve this
- Demo one time pass before
- Record in one go
- Edit later
- Recording + Edit + Production Resolutions

When I listen back to my very first video it does not sound great today.

When asked for tips for begineer youtuber, someone said on the internet that "Record the first 100 videos as fast as possible. Don't look at the quality but focus on the quantity. It's after the 100 that the real videos start coming out". So if you are still on the fence line don't wait any longer jump over. I am happy to help you in ways I can. Don't wait to get all the perfect equipment or tools to start. There are a lot of free tool alternatives to most of what I use, so pick one of them if you don't have a particular software. Do you have a YouTube channel and what is your workflow? Sound off in the comments.
